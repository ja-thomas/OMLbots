Description: In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with
    "-", the 63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder
    does not fill the string with trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings
    comply to the regular expression pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are
    safe to use in URLs or for file names.
    The package also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for
    case insensitive file systems.
